Amazon Sale Analysis - Power BI and SQL

Project Overview

This project analyzes ride-booking data using SQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into booking trends, ride cancellations, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

SQL Queries

The following SQL queries are designed to extract critical insights from the ride-booking dataset:

Retrieve all successful bookings

Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type

Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers

List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides

Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues

Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings

Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI

Find the average customer rating per vehicle type

Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully

List all incomplete rides along with the reason

Power BI Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes various interactive reports and charts to visualize the ride-booking dataset:

Ride Volume Over Time - Tracks ride volume trends over different periods.

Booking Status Breakdown - Displays a summary of ride statuses (Completed, Cancelled, etc.).

Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance - Identifies vehicle types with the highest ride distances.

Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type - Compares customer ratings across different vehicle types.

Cancelled Rides Reasons - Analyzes reasons for ride cancellations.

Revenue by Payment Method - Shows revenue distribution based on payment modes.

Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value - Highlights the highest-paying customers.

Ride Distance Distribution Per Day - Examines how ride distances vary daily.

Driver Ratings Distribution - Displays rating patterns for drivers.

Customer vs. Driver Ratings - Compares ratings given by customers and drivers.
