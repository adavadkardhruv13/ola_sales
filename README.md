# OLA Sale Analysis - Power BI and SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes ride-booking data using SQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into booking trends, ride cancellations, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

## SQL Queries
The following SQL queries are designed to extract critical insights from the ride-booking dataset:

1. **Retrieve all successful bookings**
2. **Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type**
3. **Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers**
4. **List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides**
5. **Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues**
6. **Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings**
7. **Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI**
8. **Find the average customer rating per vehicle type**
9. **Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully**
10. **List all incomplete rides along with the reason**

## Power BI Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes various interactive reports and charts to visualize the ride-booking dataset:

1. **Ride Volume Over Time** - Tracks ride volume trends over different periods.
2. **Booking Status Breakdown** - Displays a summary of ride statuses (Completed, Cancelled, etc.).
3. **Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance** - Identifies vehicle types with the highest ride distances.
4. **Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type** - Compares customer ratings across different vehicle types.
5. **Cancelled Rides Reasons** - Analyzes reasons for ride cancellations.
6. **Revenue by Payment Method** - Shows revenue distribution based on payment modes.
7. **Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value** - Highlights the highest-paying customers.
8. **Ride Distance Distribution Per Day** - Examines how ride distances vary daily.
9. **Driver Ratings Distribution** - Displays rating patterns for drivers.
10. **Customer vs. Driver Ratings** - Compares ratings given by customers and drivers.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL) for querying ride data
- **Power BI** for creating dashboards and visualizations
- **Python**  for additional data processing

## How to Use
1. Run the provided SQL queries on your database to extract insights.
2. Use Power BI to connect to the database or CSV files and load data.
3. Import the Power BI report file to visualize and analyze the results.
4. Customize the dashboards based on your analysis needs.
